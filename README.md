# Real-time Stream Processing with Apache Kafka Streams

This repository contains materials for a course on building large-scale real-time stream processing pipelines using Apache Kafka Streams and other related technologies.

## Overview

In the era of big data, we generate vast amounts of information daily. This enormous data pool holds insights about human and system behavior that, when processed and analyzed in real-time, can drive business actions leading to improved sales, customer satisfaction, system reliability, and disaster prevention. The skill to build these large-scale real-time stream processing pipelines is a critical asset for any data engineer.

This course presents popular streaming use cases and how to solve them by combining various technologies. It also discusses four popular patterns for stream processing through example use cases. By the end of the course, students will have a use case to implement using the learned patterns.

## Technologies

The course makes use of the following technologies:
- Spring Boot
- Apache Kafka Streams
- Apache Kafka
- MySQL
- Redis

Please note that a familiarity with these technologies, along with Java development, is expected for anyone undertaking the course.

## Objective

The ultimate goal of the course is to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to solve real-world stream processing problems using Kafka Streams.

Let's embark on this journey to solving stream processing problems with Kafka Streams together!
